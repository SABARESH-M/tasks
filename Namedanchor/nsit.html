            In 1966, he acquired Narasu's Coffee Company at the age of 35, with a mindset to turn things around in the coffee industry and since then there was no looking back. In a short span of time, the sales increased from 300 – 400 metric tons to 5700 metric tons per year. He simultaneously devel- oped coffee plantations which supplied raw coffee for his own company and was open to sales in the market. In short, under his supervision, coffee was grown, cultivated, roasted, ground, packaged and marketed with high degree of quality control. This could be achieved only because of the dedication, hard work, honesty, business ethics and a good market understanding. Hence, the brand “Narasu's” became popular in the Indian and International markets.</p>

                The business knowledge of Sri “Narasu's” R.P. Sarathy was so vast that the entire coffee industry relied on his suggestions. He served as a Coffee Board Trade member for seven terms (21 years). One of his notable achievements during this tenure was to make coffee into a free market. As an effect of this resolu- tion, the purchase and sales of coffee became competitive and in par with the quality of the product. With his experience in the coffee industry he diversified into various other industries under the brand name “Narasu's”. They are: Narasu's Coffee Company, Narasu's Exports, Narasu's Roller Flour Mills, Narasu's Spinning Mills, Narasu's Sarathy Jewellery, Narasu's Sarathy Institute of Technology, Narasu's Sarathy Industries, Mahalakshmi Oil Refineries, Coffee Estates, Hotels.
